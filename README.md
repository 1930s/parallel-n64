mupen64plus-libretro
====================

DOES NOT WORK

Based on latest version of mupen64plus hg (~2.0 rc2) and patches I originally made for mednafen-ps3.
Emulation, audio, and input work.
video-rice is compiled in but gives only a black screen for output, probably needs to be patched up to work with libretro's OpenGL interface.

Will only build on OS X 10.8, not usable in its current state.
